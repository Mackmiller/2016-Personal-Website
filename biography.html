      <p class="resume">Mackenzie Miller, flute, is majoring in Instrumental Performance at the University of Miami Frost School of Music, where she is a University of Miami President’s Music Scholarship recipient and a Disney Scholar. She studies privately with Trudy Kane.  At school she is a member of the Frost Symphony Orchestra as well as the Frost Wind Ensemble. She runs an active flute studio during the school year, consisting of students of all ages and ability levels. Mackenzie’s teaching style varies depending on individual’s interest and need, but consistently focuses on achieving improvement through positivity, encouragement, and a core enjoyment of playing the flute. She enjoys volunteering as an instructor for various flute sectionals in local middle and high schools, as well as for adult programs such as the New Horizons Band. She regularly performs in local Miami hospitals for patients and their families as part of the Ress Family Project.  Outside of music, Mackenzie enjoys taking classes to pursue her interests in psychology, web design, and graphic design. She also enjoys spending time in her garden of cacti and succulents. </p>
